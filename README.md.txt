Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files,
 originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.
 Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
 It is also known as a devops tool.
